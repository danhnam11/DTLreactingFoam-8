# DTLreactingFoam-8

## General Information
A package for high fidelity simulations of laminar reacting flows in OF-8 with low computational cost, incorporating both the detailed transport model (DTM) and the polynomial fit transport model (FTM) based on the principle of kinetic gas theory [1]. To enhance computational efficiency, it was integrated with the time-correlated thermophysical property calculation (coTHERM) method. This technique can significantly reduce the computational cost of numerical simulations using DTM/FTM in OF-8 while preserving accuracy. Readers are referred to our paper for all validation data.

## Installation
- The complete installation of the OpenFOAM 8.0 framework in a Linux operating system is required before installing this package, as it is designed for the Linux-based OpenFOAM 8.0 version. 
- Prepare a directory on your system, for example, _yourDirectory_:

		mkdir ~/OpenFOAM/yourDirectory/
		cd ~/OpenFOAM/yourDirectory/	
- Download source files using git: 

		git clone https://github.com/danhnam11/DTLreactingFoam-8.git

- Specify the path of the _src_ directory of this package to an environment variable named _LIB_DTL_SRC_. Suppose the _DTLreactingFoam-8_ have downloaded into _yourDirectory_. Then the following commands should be executed to specify the path of the _src_:

		echo "export LIB_DTL_SRC=~/OpenFOAM/yourDirectory/DTLreactingFoam-8/src/" >> ~/.bashrc
		source ~/.bashrc

- To compile the necessary libraries and solver, go to _DTLreactingFoam-8_ directory and run the _Allwmake_ script (it may take one hour to be finished):

		cd ~/OpenFOAM/yourDirectory/DTLreactingFoam-8/
		./Allwmake

- After successful compilation, the following libraries are saved at _$FOAM_USER_LIBBIN_ :

		libODE.so*
		libspecie.so*
		libthermophysicalProperties.so*
		libfluidThermophysicalModels.so*
		libreactionThermophysicalModels.so*
  		libchemistryModel.so*
		libsolidThermo.so*
		libmomentumTransportModels.so*
  		libfluidThermoMomentumTransportModels.so*
  		libthermophysicalTransportModels.so*
		libpsiReactionThermophysicalTransportModels.so*
		librhoReactionThermophysicalTransportModels.so*
		libradiationModels.so*
		libcombustionModels.so*
		libfvOptions.so*
		libspecieTransfer.so*
  
- and the following executable programs are saved at _$FOAM_USER_APPBIN_ :

		DTLreactingFoam*
  		DTMchemkinToFoam*
		FTMchemkinToFoam*
  		chemkinToFoam*
		reactingFoam*

- These newly compiled libraries, solvers, and utilities are now ready for use.
- It is important to note that if a different solver (i.e., program) relies on any of the aforementioned compiled libraries, its corresponding _options_ file, located in the _Make_ directory, must be updated accordingly. The solver should then be recompiled to prevent potential conflicts, such as segmentation faults. For reference, the _Make_ directory of the _reactingFoam_ solver included in this package provides a convenient example. Although this version of _reactingFoam_ is nearly identical to the original, its _options_ file has been modified to link against compiled libraries in this package. As a result, it can be used seamlessly in place of the original version without issue.

- To remove all compiled libraries and solvers, go to _DTLreactingFoam-8_ directory and run the _Allwclean_ script:

		cd ~/OpenFOAM/yourDirectory/DTLreactingFoam-8/
		./Allwclean

## Using this package 
Upon completing the compilation process, the _DTLreactingFoam_ solver can be utilized by simply typing its name in the terminal, _DTLreactingFoam_. All important instructions for case setting are provided in _documentations_ directory.

## Tutorials
Several test cases (e.g., canonical cases in combustion) are available in the _tutorials_ directory.

	cd ~/OpenFOAM/yourDirectory/DTLreactingFoam-8/tutorials/
